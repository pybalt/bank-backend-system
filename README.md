# bank-backend-system
This is my first solo project. This project is about backend and resumes all my current knowledge as a trainee developer.

I'm going to make a digital bank. The app will going to be used for loans, check movements, see your bank cards, the bank will have several branchs, employee and customers.

Also the app is going to have an API with several endpoints to interact with.
